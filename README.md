# Graphite: Custom Graphing calculator

## What is this?

This is a custom-made graphing calculator built off of the [Rasberry Pi Picos](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
There are a couple of reasons I chose this board: 
1. they're cheap, and easy to get a hold of.
2. if a new one (with the same form factor and compatible pinout) comes out, you can swap it out, giving you a more powerful cpu, more storage, etc.

## But _Why_ did you make this?

I made this because this is my first ever PCB and thing like this. _Also_, I really wanted to fix some things that I found wrong with the TI-84s and such.
